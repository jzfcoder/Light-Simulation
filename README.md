# Light Simulation

A simple procedural light simulation for point lights and rays. Customize different maps, walls, and lights, with the ability to save as a .txt or interact realtime

## Description

Each light is composed of multiple rays, which are drawn from the center point in varying directions. Each ray continues until it reaches the edge of the map, a wall, or the light's maximum strength.
